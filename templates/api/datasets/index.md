# Datasets

The `tf.keras.datasets` module provide a few toy datasets (already-vectorized, in Numpy format)
that can be used for debugging a model or creating simple code examples.

If you are looking for larger & more useful ready-to-use datasets, take a look at
[TensorFlow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets).
