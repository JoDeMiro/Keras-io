# Getting started

Are you an engineer or data scientist? Do you ship reliable and performant applied machine learning solutions?
Check out our **[Introduction to Keras for engineers](/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers)**.

Are you a machine learning researcher? Do you publish at NeurIPS and push the state-of-the-art in CV and NLP?
Check out our **[Introduction to Keras for researchers](/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_researchers)**.

Are you a beginner looking for both an introduction to machine learning and an introduction to Keras and TensorFlow?
You're going to need more than a one-pager. And you're in luck:
**[we've got just the book for you](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition?a_aid=keras)**.

## Installing Keras

To use Keras, will need to have the TensorFlow package installed. [See detailed instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

Once TensorFlow is installed, just import Keras via:

```python
from tensorflow import keras
```

The Keras codebase is also available on GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/keras-team/keras.git
```

You can download an archive of the Keras code below:
