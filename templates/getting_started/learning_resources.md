# Learning resources

This page is a compilation of learning resources for modern Keras / TensorFlow 2 best practices.

Notes that best starter resources are still our [developer guides](/guides/), our [official code examples](/examples/),
as well as the [tutorials on tensorflow.org](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).

If this is your first contact with Keras, you can also check out the guides
[Introduction to Keras for researchers](/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_researchers/) and
[Introduction to Keras for engineers](/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/).
