    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) are a popular\n",
    "class of generative deep learning models, commonly used for image generation. They\n",
    "consist of a pair of dueling neural networks, called the discriminator and the generator.\n",
    "The discriminator's task is to distinguish real images from generated (fake) ones, while\n",
    "the generator network tries to fool the discriminator by generating more and more\n",
    "realistic images. If the generator is however too easy or too hard to fool, it might fail\n",
    "to provide useful learning signal for the generator, therefore training GANs is usually\n",
    "considered a difficult task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data augmentation for GANS\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation, a popular technique in deep learning, is the process of randomly\n",
    "applying semantics-preserving transformations to the input data to generate multiple\n",
    "realistic versions of it, thereby effectively multiplying the amount of training data\n",
    "available. The simplest example is left-right flipping an image, which preserves its\n",
    "contents while generating a second unique training sample. Data augmentation is commonly\n",
    "used in supervised learning to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06676) show that discriminator\n",
    "overfitting can be an issue in GANs, especially when only low amounts of training data is\n",
    "available. They propose Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation to mitigate this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying data augmentation to GANs however is not straightforward. Since the generator is\n",
    "updated using the discriminator's gradients, if the generated images are augmented, the\n",
    "augmentation pipeline has to be differentiable and also has to be GPU-compatible for\n",
    "computational efficiency. Luckily, the\n",
    "[Keras image augmentation layers](https://keras.io/api/layers/preprocessing_layers/image_augmentation/)\n",
    "fulfill both these requirements, and are therefore very well suited for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invertible data augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible difficulty when using data augmentation in generative models is the issue of\n",
    "[\"leaky augmentations\" (section 2.2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06676), namely when the\n",
    "model generates images that are already augmented. This would mean that it was not able\n",
    "to separate the augmentation from the underlying data distribution, which can be caused\n",
    "by using non-invertible data transformations. For example, if either 0, 90, 180 or 270\n",
    "degree rotations are performed with equal probability, the original orientation of the\n",
    "images is impossible to infer, and this information is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple trick to make data augmentations invertible is to only apply them with some\n",
    "probability. That way the original version of the images will be more common, and the\n",
    "data distribution can be infered. By properly choosing this probability, one can\n",
    "effectively regularize the discriminator without making the augmentations leaky."

    "### Architectural tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **resolution**: Training GANs at higher resolutions tends to get more difficult, I\n",
    "recommend experimenting at 32x32 or 64x64 resolutions initially.\n",
    "* **initialization**: If you see strong colorful patterns early on in the training, the\n",
    "initalization might be the issue. Set the kernel_initializer parameters of layers to\n",
    "[random normal](https://keras.io/api/layers/initializers/#randomnormal-class), and\n",
    "decrease the standard deviation (recommended value: 0.02, following DCGAN) until the\n",
    "issue disappears.\n",
    "* **upsampling**: There are two main methods for upsampling in the generator.\n",
    "[Transposed convolution](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d_transpose/)\n",
    "is faster, but can lead to\n",
    "[checkerboard artifacts](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/), which can be reduced by using\n",
    "a kernel size that is divisible with the stride (recommended kernel size is 4 for a stride of 2).\n",
    "[Upsampling](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/up_sampling2d/) +\n",
    "[standard convolution](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/) can have slightly\n",
    "lower quality, but checkerboard artifacts are not an issue. I recommend using nearest-neighbor\n",
    "interpolation over bilinear for it.\n",
    "* **batch normalization in discriminator**: Sometimes has a high impact, I recommend\n",
    "trying out both ways.\n",
    "* **[spectral normalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/layers/SpectralNormalization)**:\n",
    "A popular technique for training GANs, can help with stability. I recommend\n",
    "disabling batch normalization's learnable scale parameters along with it.\n",
    "* **[residual connections](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/#a-toy-resnet-model)**:\n",
    "While residual discriminators behave similarly, residual generators are more difficult to\n",
    "train in my experience. They are however necessary for training large and deep\n",
    "architectures. I recommend starting with non-resiudal architectures.\n",
    "* **dropout**: Using dropout before the last layer of the discriminator improves\n",
    "generation quality in my experience. Recommended dropout rate is below 0.5.\n",
    "* **[leaky ReLU](https://keras.io/api/layers/activation_layers/leaky_relu/)**: Use leaky\n",
    "ReLU activations in the discriminator to make its gradients less sparse. Recommended\n",
    "slope/alpha is 0.2 following DCGAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **loss functions**: Numerous losses have been proposed over the years for training\n",
    "GANs, promising improved performance and stability. I have implemented 5 of them in\n",
    "[this repository](https://github.com/beresandras/gan-flavours-keras), and my experience is in\n",
    "line with [this GAN study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10337): no loss seems to\n",
    "consistently outperform the default non-saturating GAN loss. I recommend using that as a\n",
    "default.\n",
    "* **Adam's beta_1 parameter**: The beta_1 parameter in Adam can be interpreted as the\n",
    "momentum of mean gradient estimation. Using 0.5 or even 0.0 instead of the default 0.9\n",
    "value was proposed in DCGAN and is important. This example would not work using its\n",
    "default value.\n",
    "* **separate batch normalization for generated and real images**: The forward pass of the\n",
    "discriminator should be separate for the generated and real images. Doing otherwise can\n",
    "lead to artifacts (45 degree stripes in my case) and decreased performance.\n",
    "* **exponential moving average of generator's weights**: This helps to reduce the\n",
    "variance of the KID measurement, and helps in averaging out the rapid color palette\n",
    "changes during training.\n",
    "* **[different learning rate for generator and discriminator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500)**:\n",
    "If one has the resources, it can help\n",
    "to tune the learning rates of the two networks separately. A similar idea is to update\n",
    "either network's (usually the discriminator's) weights multiple times for each of the\n",
    "other network's updates. I recommend using the same learning rate of 2e-4 (Adam),\n",
