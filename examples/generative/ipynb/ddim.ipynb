    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are diffusion models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, [denoising diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239), including\n",
    "[score-based generative models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600), gained popularity as a\n",
    "powerful class of generative models, that can [rival](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233)\n",
    "even [generative adversarial networks (GANs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) in image\n",
    "synthesis quality. They tend to generate more diverse samples, while being stable to\n",
    "train and easy to scale. Recent large diffusion models, such as\n",
    "[DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/),\n",
    "have shown incredible text-to-image generation capability. One of their drawbacks is\n",
    "however, that they are slower to sample from, because they require multiple forward passes\n",
    "for generating an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion refers to the process of turning a structured signal (an image) into noise\n",
    "step-by-step. By simulating diffusion, we can generate noisy images from our training\n",
    "images, and can train a neural network to try to denoise them. Using the trained network\n",
    "we can simulate the opposite of diffusion, reverse diffusion, which is the process of an\n",
    "image emerging from noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "![diffusion process gif](https://i.imgur.com/dipPOfa.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "One-sentence summary: **diffusion models are trained to denoise noisy images, and can\n",
    "generate images by iteratively denoising pure noise.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of this example\n",
    "\n",
    "This code example intends to be a minimal but feature-complete (with a generation quality\n",
    "metric) implementation of diffusion models, with modest compute requirements and\n",
    "reasonable performance. My implementation choices and hyperparameter tuning were done\n",
    "with these goals in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since currently the literature of diffusion models is\n",
    "[mathematically quite complex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364)\n",
    "with multiple theoretical frameworks\n",
    "([score matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600),\n",
    "[differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456),\n",
    "[Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)) and sometimes even\n",
    "[conflicting notations (see Appendix C.2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502),\n",
    "it can be daunting trying to understand\n",
    "them. My view of these models in this example will be that they learn to separate a\n",
    "noisy image into its image and Gaussian noise components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example I made effort to break down all long mathematical expressions into\n",
    "digestible pieces and gave all variables explanatory names. I also included numerous\n",
    "links to relevant literature to help interested readers dive deeper into the topic, in\n",
    "the hope that this code example will become a good starting point for practitioners\n",
    "learning about diffusion models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will implement a continous time version of\n",

    "Let us say, that a diffusion process starts at time = 0, and ends at time = 1. This\n",
    "variable will be called diffusion time, and can be either discrete (common in diffusion\n",
    "models) or continuous (common in score-based models). I choose the latter, so that the\n",
    "number of sampling steps can be changed at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to have a function that tells us at each point in the diffusion process the noise\n",
    "levels and signal levels of the noisy image corresponding to the actual diffusion time.\n",
    "This will be called the diffusion schedule (see `diffusion_schedule()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This schedule outputs two quantities: the `noise_rate` and the `signal_rate`\n",
    "(corresponding to sqrt(1 - alpha) and sqrt(alpha) in the DDIM paper, respectively). We\n",
    "generate the noisy image by weighting the random noise and the training image by their\n",
    "corresponding rates and adding them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the (standard normal) random noises and the (normalized) images both have zero mean\n",
    "and unit variance, the noise rate and signal rate can be interpreted as the standard\n",
    "deviation of their components in the noisy image, while the squares of their rates can be\n",
    "interpreted as their variance (or their power in the signal processing sense). The rates\n",

    "In this section I list\n",
    "the lessons learned and my recommendations in my subjective order of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **min. and max. signal rates**: I found the min. signal rate to be an important\n",
    "hyperparameter. Setting it too low will make the generated images oversaturated, while\n",
    "setting it too high will make them undersaturated. I recommend tuning it carefully. Also,\n",
    "setting it to 0 will lead to a division by zero error. The max. signal rate can be set to\n",
    "1, but I found that setting it lower slightly improves generation quality.\n",
    "* **loss function**: While large models tend to use mean squared error (MSE) loss, I\n",
    "recommend using mean absolute error (MAE) on this dataset. In my experience MSE loss\n",
    "generates more diverse samples (it also seems to hallucinate more\n",
    "[Section 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05826)), while MAE loss leads to smoother images.\n",
    "I recommend trying both.\n",
    "* **weight decay**: I did occasionally run into diverged trainings when scaling up the\n",
    "model, and found that weight decay helps in avoiding instabilities at a low performance\n",
    "cost. This is why I use\n",
    "[AdamW](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/experimental/AdamW)\n",
    "instead of [Adam](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/adam/) in this example.\n",
    "* **exponential moving average of weights**: This helps to reduce the variance of the KID\n",
    "metric, and helps in averaging out short-term changes during training.\n",
    "* **image augmentations**: Though I did not use image augmentations in this example, in\n",
    "my experience adding horizontal flips to the training increases generation performance,\n",
    "while random crops do not. Since we use a supervised denoising loss, overfitting can be\n",
    "an issue, so image augmentations might be important on small datasets. One should also be\n",
    "careful not to use\n",
    "[leaky augmentations](https://keras.io/examples/generative/gan_ada/#invertible-data-augmentation),\n",
    "which can be done following\n",
    "[this method (end of Section 5)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) for instance.\n",
    "* **data normalization**: In the literature the pixel values of images are usually\n",
    "converted to the -1 to 1 range. For theoretical correctness, I normalize the images to\n",
    "have zero mean and unit variance instead, exactly like the random noises.\n",
    "* **noise level input**: I chose to input the noise variance to the network, as it is\n",
    "symmetrical under our sampling schedule. One could also input the noise rate (similar\n",
    "performance), the signal rate (lower performance), or even the\n",
    "[log-signal-to-noise ratio (Appendix B.1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00630)\n",
    "(did not try, as its range is highly\n",
    "dependent on the min. and max. signal rates, and would require adjusting the min.\n",
    "embedding frequency accordingly).\n",
    "* **gradient clipping**: Using global gradient clipping with a value of 1 can help with\n",
    "training stability for large models, but decreased performance significantly in my\n",
    "experience.\n",
    "* **residual connection downscaling**: For\n",
    "[deeper models (Appendix B)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487), scaling the residual\n",
    "connections with 1/sqrt(2) can be helpful, but did not help in my case.\n",
    "* **learning rate**: For me, [Adam optimizer's](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/adam/)\n",
    "default learning rate of 1e-3 worked very well, but lower learning rates are more common\n",
    "in the [literature (Tables 11-13)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architectural tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **sinusoidal embedding**: Using sinusoidal embeddings on the noise level input of the\n",
    "network is crucial for good performance. I recommend setting the min. embedding frequency\n",
    "to the reciprocal of the range of this input, and since we use the noise variance in this\n",
    "example, it can be left always at 1. The max. embedding frequency controls the smallest\n",
    "change in the noise variance that the network will be sensitive to, and the embedding\n",
    "dimensions set the number of frequency components in the embedding. In my experience the\n",
    "performance is not too sensitive to these values.\n",
    "* **skip connections**: Using skip connections in the network architecture is absolutely\n",
    "critical, without them the model will fail to learn to denoise at a good performance.\n",
    "* **residual connections**: In my experience residual connections also significantly\n",
    "improve performance, but this might be due to the fact that we only input the noise\n",
    "level embeddings to the first layer of the network instead of to all of them.\n",
    "* **normalization**: When scaling up the model, I did occasionally encounter diverged\n",
    "trainings, using normalization layers helped to mitigate this issue. In the literature it\n",
    "is common to use\n",
    "[GroupNormalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/layers/GroupNormalization)\n",
    "(with 8 groups for example) or\n",
    "[LayerNormalization](https://keras.io/api/layers/normalization_layers/layer_normalization/)\n",
    "in the network, I however chose to use\n",
    "[BatchNormalization](https://keras.io/api/layers/normalization_layers/batch_normalization/),\n",
    "as it gave similar benefits in my experiments but was computationally lighter.\n",
    "* **activations**: The choice of activation functions had a larger effect on generation\n",
    "quality than I expected. In my experiments using non-monotonic activation functions\n",
    "outperformed monotonic ones (such as\n",
    "[ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/relu)), with\n",
    "[Swish](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/swish) performing\n",
    "the best (this is also what [Imagen uses, page 41](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487)).\n",
    "* **attention**: As mentioned earlier, it is common in the literature to use\n",
    "[attention layers](https://keras.io/api/layers/attention_layers/multi_head_attention/) at low\n",
    "resolutions for better global coherence. I ommitted them for simplicity.\n",
    "* **upsampling**:\n",
    "[Bilinear and nearest neighbour upsampling](https://keras.io/api/layers/reshaping_layers/up_sampling2d/)\n",
    "in the network performed similarly, I did not try\n",
