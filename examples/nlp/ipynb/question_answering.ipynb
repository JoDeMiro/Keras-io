    "## Introduction to Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "Question answering is a common NLP task with several variants. In some variants, the task\n",
    "is multiple-choice:\n",
    "A list of possible answers are supplied with each question, and the model simply needs to\n",
    "return a probability distribution over the options. A more challenging variant of\n",
    "question answering, which is more applicable to real-life tasks, is when the options are\n",
    "not provided. Instead, the model is given an input document -- called context -- and a\n",
    "question about the document, and it must extract the span of text in the document that\n",
    "contains the answer. In this case, the model is not computing a probability distribution\n",
    "over answers, but two probability distributions over the tokens in the document text,\n",
    "representing the start and end of the span containing the answer. This variant is called\n",
    "\"extractive question answering\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive question answering is a very challenging NLP task, and the dataset size\n",
    "required to train such a model from scratch when the questions and answers are natural\n",
    "language is prohibitively huge. As a result, question answering (like almost all NLP\n",
    "tasks) benefits enormously from starting from a strong pretrained foundation model -\n",
    "starting from a strong pretrained language model can reduce the dataset size required to\n",
    "reach a given accuracy by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling you to reach very strong\n",
    "performance with surprisingly reasonable datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with a pretrained model adds difficulties, though - where do you get the model\n",
    "from? How do you ensure that your input data is preprocessed and tokenized the same way\n",
    "as the original model? How do you modify the model to add an output head that matches\n",
    "your task of interest?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll show you how to load a model from the Hugging Face\n",
    "[\ud83e\udd17Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library to tackle this\n",
    "challenge. We'll also load a benchmark question answering dataset from the\n",
    "[\ud83e\udd17Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library - this is another open-source\n",
    "repository containing a wide range of datasets across many modalities, from NLP to vision\n",
    "and beyond. Note, though, that there is no requirement that these libraries must be used\n",
