    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With the growth of data-centric Machine Learning, Active Learning has grown in popularity\n",
    "amongst businesses and researchers. Active Learning seeks to progressively\n",
    "train ML models so that the resultant model requires lesser amount of training data to\n",
    "achieve competitive scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of an Active Learning pipeline involves a classifier and an oracle. The\n",
    "oracle is an annotator that cleans, selects, labels the data, and feeds it to the model\n",
    "when required. The oracle is a trained individual or a group of individuals that\n",
    "ensure consistency in labeling of new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts with annotating a small subset of the full dataset and training an\n",
    "initial model. The best model checkpoint is saved and then tested on\u00a0a balanced test\n",
    "set. The test set must be carefully sampled because the full training process will be\n",
    "dependent on it. Once we have the initial evaluation scores, the oracle is tasked with\n",
    "labeling more samples; the number of data points to be sampled is usually determined by\n",
    "the business requirements. After that, the newly sampled data is added to the training\n",
    "set, and the training procedure repeats. This cycle continues until either an\n",
    "acceptable score is reached or some other business metric is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a basic demonstration of how Active Learning works by\n",
    "demonstrating a ratio-based (least confidence) sampling strategy that results in lower\n",
    "overall false positive and negative rates when compared to a model trained on the entire\n",
    "dataset. This sampling falls under the domain of *uncertanity sampling*, in which new\n",
    "datasets are sampled based on the uncertanity that the model outputs for the\n",
    "corresponding label. In our example, we compare our model's false positive and false\n",
    "negative rates and annotate the new data based on their ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other sampling techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Committee sampling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51909346_Committee-Based_Sample_Selection_for_Probabilistic_Classifiers):\n",
    "Using multiple models to vote for the best data points to be sampled\n",
    "2. [Entropy reduction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51909346_Committee-Based_Sample_Selection_for_Probabilistic_Classifiers):\n",
    "Sampling according to an entropy threshold, selecting more of the samples that produce the highest entropy score.\n",
    "3. [Minimum margin based sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00025v1):\n",
    "Selects data points closest to the decision boundary"

    "\n",
    "Active Learning is a growing area of research. This example demonstrates the cost-efficiency\n",

    "data, saving resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some noteworthy observations from this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We only require 30,000 samples to reach the same (if not better) scores as the model\n",
    "trained on the full datatset. This means that in a real life setting, we save the effort\n",
    "required for annotating 10,000 images!\n",
    "2. The number of false negatives and false positives are well balanced at the end of the\n",
    "training as compared to the skewed ratio obtained from the full training. This makes the\n",
    "model slightly more useful in real life scenarios where both the labels hold equal\n",
