## Introduction

With the growth of data-centric Machine Learning, Active Learning has grown in popularity
amongst businesses and researchers. Active Learning seeks to progressively
train ML models so that the resultant model requires lesser amount of training data to
achieve competitive scores.

The structure of an Active Learning pipeline involves a classifier and an oracle. The
oracle is an annotator that cleans, selects, labels the data, and feeds it to the model
when required. The oracle is a trained individual or a group of individuals that
ensure consistency in labeling of new data.

The process starts with annotating a small subset of the full dataset and training an
initial model. The best model checkpoint is saved and then tested onÂ a balanced test
set. The test set must be carefully sampled because the full training process will be
dependent on it. Once we have the initial evaluation scores, the oracle is tasked with
labeling more samples; the number of data points to be sampled is usually determined by
the business requirements. After that, the newly sampled data is added to the training
set, and the training procedure repeats. This cycle continues until either an
acceptable score is reached or some other business metric is met.

This tutorial provides a basic demonstration of how Active Learning works by
demonstrating a ratio-based (least confidence) sampling strategy that results in lower
overall false positive and negative rates when compared to a model trained on the entire
dataset. This sampling falls under the domain of *uncertanity sampling*, in which new
datasets are sampled based on the uncertanity that the model outputs for the
corresponding label. In our example, we compare our model's false positive and false
negative rates and annotate the new data based on their ratio.

Some other sampling techniques include:

1. [Committee sampling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51909346_Committee-Based_Sample_Selection_for_Probabilistic_Classifiers):
Using multiple models to vote for the best data points to be sampled
2. [Entropy reduction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51909346_Committee-Based_Sample_Selection_for_Probabilistic_Classifiers):
Sampling according to an entropy threshold, selecting more of the samples that produce the highest entropy score.
3. [Minimum margin based sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00025v1):
Selects data points closest to the decision boundary

## Training via Active Learning

The general process we follow when performing Active Learning is demonstrated below:

![Active Learning](https://i.imgur.com/dmNKusp.png)

The pipeline can be summarized in five parts:

1. Sample and annotate a small, balanced training dataset
2. Train the model on this small subset
3. Evaluate the model on a balanced testing set
4. If the model satisfies the business criteria, deploy it in a real time setting
5. If it doesn't pass the criteria, sample a few more samples according to the ratio of
false positives and negatives, add them to the training set and repeat from step 2 till
the model passes the tests or till all available data is exhausted.

For the code below, we will perform sampling using the following formula:<br/>

![Ratio Sampling](https://i.imgur.com/LyZEiZL.png)

Active Learning techniques use callbacks extensively for progress tracking. We will be
using model checkpointing and early stopping for this example. The `patience` parameter
for Early Stopping can help minimize overfitting and the time required. We have set it
`patience=4` for now but since the model is robust, we can increase the patience level if
desired.

Note: We are not loading the checkpoint after the first training iteration. In my
experience working on Active Learning techniques, this helps the model probe the
newly formed loss landscape. Even if the model fails to improve in the second iteration,
we will still gain insight about the possible future false positive and negative rates.
This will help us sample a better set in the next iteration where the model will have a
greater chance to improve.

## Conclusion

Active Learning is a growing area of research. This example demonstrates the cost-efficiency
benefits of using Active Learning, as it eliminates the need to annotate large amounts of
data, saving resources.

The following are some noteworthy observations from this example:

1. We only require 30,000 samples to reach the same (if not better) scores as the model
trained on the full datatset. This means that in a real life setting, we save the effort
required for annotating 10,000 images!
2. The number of false negatives and false positives are well balanced at the end of the
training as compared to the skewed ratio obtained from the full training. This makes the
model slightly more useful in real life scenarios where both the labels hold equal
importance.
