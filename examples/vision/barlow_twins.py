## Introduction
"""

"""
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a relatively novel technique in which a model
learns from unlabeled data, and is often used when the data is corrupted or
if there is very little of it. A practical use for SSL is to create
intermediate embeddings that are learned from the data. These embeddings are
based on the dataset itself, with similar images having similar embeddings, and
vice versa. They are then attached to the rest of the model, which uses those
embeddings as information and effectively learns and makes predictions properly.
These embeddings, ideally, should contain as much information and insight about
the data as possible, so that the model can make better predictions. However,
a common problem that arises is that the model creates embeddings that are
redundant. For example, if two images are similar, the model will create
embeddings that are just a string of 1's, or some other value that
contains repeating bits of information. This is no better than a one-hot
encoding or just having one bit as the modelâ€™s representations; it defeats the
purpose of the embeddings, as they do not learn as much about the dataset as
possible. For other approaches, the solution to the problem was to carefully
configure the model such that it tries not to be redundant.


Barlow Twins is a new approach to this problem; while other solutions mainly
tackle the first goal of invariance (similar images have similar embeddings),
the Barlow Twins method also prioritizes the goal of reducing redundancy.

It also has the advantage of being much simpler than other methods, and its
model architecture is symmetric, meaning that both twins in the model do the
same thing. It is also near state-of-the-art on imagenet, even exceeding methods
like SimCLR.


One disadvantage of Barlow Twins is that it is heavily dependent on
augmentation, suffering major performance decreases in accuracy without them.

TL, DR: Barlow twins creates representations that are:

*   Invariant.
*   Not redundant, and carry as much info about the dataset.

Also, it is simpler than other methods.

This notebook can train a Barlow Twins model and reach up to
64% validation accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### High-Level Theory


"""

"""
The model takes two versions of the same image(with different augmentations) as
input. Then it takes a prediction of each of them, creating representations.
They are then used to make a cross-correlation matrix.

Cross-correlation matrix:
```
(pred_1.T @ pred_2) / batch_size
```

The cross-correlation matrix measures the correlation between the output
neurons in the two representations made by the model predictions of the two
augmented versions of data. Ideally, a cross-correlation matrix should look
like an identity matrix if the two images are the same.

When this happens, it means that the representations:

1.   Are invariant. The diagonal shows the correlation between each
representation's neurons and its corresponding augmented one. Because the two
versions come from the same image, the diagonal of the matrix should show that
there is a strong correlation between them. If the images are different, there
shouldn't be a diagonal.
2.   Do not show signs of redundancy. If the neurons show correlation with a
non-diagonal neuron, it means that it is not correctly identifying similarities
between the two augmented images. This means that it is redundant.

Here is a good way of understanding in pseudocode(information from the original
paper):

```
c[i][i] = 1
c[i][j] = 0

where:
  c is the cross-correlation matrix
  i is the index of one representation's neuron
  j is the index of the second representation's neuron
```

probabilistically occur.

## Conclusion

*   Barlow Twins is a simple and concise method for contrastive and self-supervised
learning.
*   With this resnet-34 model architecture, we were able to reach 62-64% validation
accuracy.

## Use-Cases of Barlow-Twins(and contrastive learning in General)

*   Semi-supervised learning: You can see that this model gave a 62-64% boost in accuracy
when it wasn't even trained with the labels. It can be used when you have little labeled
data but a lot of unlabeled data.
* You do barlow twins training on the unlabeled data, and then you do secondary training
with the labeled data.
