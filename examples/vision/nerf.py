Description: Minimal implementation of volumetric rendering as shown in NeRF.

## Introduction

In this example, we present a minimal implementation of the research paper
[**NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)
by Ben Mildenhall et. al. The authors have proposed an ingenious way
to *synthesize novel views of a scene* by modelling the *volumetric
scene function* through a neural network.

To help you understand this intuitively, let's start with the following question:
*would it be possible to give to a neural
network the position of a pixel in an image, and ask the network
to predict the color at that position?*

| :---: |
| **Figure 1**: A neural network being given coordinates of an image
as input and asked to predict the color at the coordinates. |

The neural network would hypothetically *memorize* (overfit on) the
image. This means that our neural network would have encoded the entire image
in its weights. We could query the neural network with each position,
and it would eventually reconstruct the entire image.

| ![2d-test](https://i.imgur.com/6Qz5Hp1.png) |
| :---: |
| **Figure 2**: The trained neural network recreates the image from scratch. |

A question now arises, how do we extend this idea to learn a 3D
volumetric scene? Implementing a similar process as above would
require the knowledge of every voxel (volume pixel). Turns out, this
is quite a challenging task to do.

The authors of the paper propose a minimal and elegant way to learn a
3D scene using a few images of the scene. They discard the use of
voxels for training. The network learns to model the volumetric scene,
thus generating novel views (images) of the 3D scene that the model
was not shown at training time.

There are a few prerequisites one needs to understand to fully
appreciate the process. We structure the example in such a way that
you will have all the required knowledge before starting the
implementation.

The `npz` data file contains images, camera poses, and a focal length.
The images are taken from multiple camera angles as shown in
**Figure 3**.

[Source: NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) |


To understand camera poses in this context we have to first allow
ourselves to think that a *camera is a mapping between the real-world
and the 2-D image*.

Consider the following equation:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TQHKx5v.pngg" width="100" height="50"/>

Where **x** is the 2-D image point, **X** is the 3-D world point and
**P** is the camera-matrix. **P** is a 3 x 4 matrix that plays the
crucial role of mapping the real world object onto an image plane.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/chvJct5.png" width="300" height="100"/>

The camera-matrix is an *affine transform matrix* that is
concatenated with a 3 x 1 column `[image height, image width, focal length]`
to produce the *pose matrix*. This matrix is of
dimensions 3 x 5 where the first 3 x 3 block is in the cameraâ€™s point
of view. The axes are `[down, right, backwards]` or `[-y, x, z]`
where the camera is facing forwards `-z`.

The COLMAP frame is `[right, down, forwards]` or `[x, -y, -z]`. Read

## Data pipeline

Now that you've understood the notion of camera matrix
and the mapping from a 3D scene to 2D images,
let's talk about the inverse mapping, i.e. from 2D image to the 3D scene.

We'll need to talk about volumetric rendering with ray casting and tracing,
which are common computer graphics techniques.
This section will help you get to speed with these techniques.

Consider an image with `N` pixels. We shoot a ray through each pixel
and sample some points on the ray. A ray is commonly parameterized by
the equation `r(t) = o + td` where `t` is the parameter, `o` is the
origin and `d` is the unit directional vector as shown in **Figure 6**.

| ![img](https://i.imgur.com/ywrqlzt.gif) |
| :---: |
| **Figure 6**: `r(t) = o + td` where t is 3 |

In **Figure 7**, we consider a ray, and we sample some random points on
the ray. These sample points each have a unique location `(x, y, z)`
and the ray has a viewing angle `(theta, phi)`. The viewing angle is
particularly interesting as we can shoot a ray through a single pixel
in a lot of different ways, each with a unique viewing angle. Another
interesting thing to notice here is the noise that is added to the
sampling process. We add a uniform noise to each sample so that the
samples correspond to a continuous distribution. In **Figure 7** the
blue points are the evenly distributed samples and the white points
`(t1, t2, t3)` are randomly placed between the samples.

| ![img](https://i.imgur.com/r9TS2wv.gif) |
| :---: |
| **Figure 7**: Sampling the points from a ray. |

**Figure 8** showcases the entire sampling process in 3D, where you
can see the rays coming out of the white image. This means that each
pixel will have its corresponding rays and each ray will be sampled at
distinct points.

| ![3-d rays](https://i.imgur.com/hr4D2g2.gif) |
| :---: |
| **Figure 8**: Shooting rays from all the pixels of an image in 3-D |

These sampled points act as the input to the NeRF model. The model is
then asked to predict the RGB color and the volume density at that
point.

## NeRF model

The model is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with ReLU as its non-linearity.

An excerpt from the paper:

*"We encourage the representation to be multiview-consistent by
restricting the network to predict the volume density sigma as a
function of only the location `x`, while allowing the RGB color `c` to be
predicted as a function of both location and viewing direction. To
accomplish this, the MLP first processes the input 3D coordinate `x`
with 8 fully-connected layers (using ReLU activations and 256 channels
per layer), and outputs sigma and a 256-dimensional feature vector.
This feature vector is then concatenated with the camera ray's viewing
direction and passed to one additional fully-connected layer (using a
ReLU activation and 128 channels) that output the view-dependent RGB
color."*

Here we have gone for a minimal implementation and have used 64
Dense units instead of 256 as mentioned in the paper.

### Visualize the video

Here we can see the rendered 360 degree view of the scene. The model
has successfully learned the entire volumetric space through the
sparse set of images in **only 20 epochs**. You can view the
rendered video saved locally, named `rgb_video.mp4`.

## Conclusion

We have produced a minimal implementation of NeRF to provide an intuition of its
core ideas and methodology. This method has been used in various
other works in the computer graphics space.

We would like to encourage our readers to use this code as an example
and play with the hyperparameters and visualize the outputs. Below we
have also provided the outputs of the model trained for more epochs.

## Way forward
