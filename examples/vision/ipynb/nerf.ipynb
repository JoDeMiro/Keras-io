    "In this example, we present a minimal implementation of the research paper\n",
    "[**NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)\n",
    "by Ben Mildenhall et. al. The authors have proposed an ingenious way\n",
    "to *synthesize novel views of a scene* by modelling the *volumetric\n",
    "scene function* through a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you understand this intuitively, let's start with the following question:\n",
    "*would it be possible to give to a neural\n",
    "network the position of a pixel in an image, and ask the network\n",
    "to predict the color at that position?*\n",

    "| **Figure 1**: A neural network being given coordinates of an image\n",
    "as input and asked to predict the color at the coordinates. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network would hypothetically *memorize* (overfit on) the\n",
    "image. This means that our neural network would have encoded the entire image\n",
    "in its weights. We could query the neural network with each position,\n",
    "and it would eventually reconstruct the entire image.\n",

    "| **Figure 2**: The trained neural network recreates the image from scratch. |\n",
    "\n",
    "A question now arises, how do we extend this idea to learn a 3D\n",
    "volumetric scene? Implementing a similar process as above would\n",
    "require the knowledge of every voxel (volume pixel). Turns out, this\n",
    "is quite a challenging task to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the paper propose a minimal and elegant way to learn a\n",
    "3D scene using a few images of the scene. They discard the use of\n",
    "voxels for training. The network learns to model the volumetric scene,\n",
    "thus generating novel views (images) of the 3D scene that the model\n",
    "was not shown at training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few prerequisites one needs to understand to fully\n",
    "appreciate the process. We structure the example in such a way that\n",
