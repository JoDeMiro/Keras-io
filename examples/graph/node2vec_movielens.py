## Introduction

Learning useful representations from objects structured as graphs is useful for
a variety of machine learning (ML) applicationsâ€”such as social and communication networks analysis,
biomedicine studies, and recommendation systems.
[Graph representation Learning](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/) aims to
learn embeddings for the graph nodes, which can be used for a variety of ML tasks
such as node label prediction (e.g. categorizing an article based on its citations)
and link prediction (e.g. recommending an interest group to a user in a social network).

[node2vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653) is a simple, yet scalable and effective
technique for learning low-dimensional embeddings for nodes in a graph by optimizing
a neighborhood-preserving objective. The aim is to learn similar embeddings for
neighboring nodes, with respect to the graph structure.

Given your data items structured as a graph (where the items are represented as
nodes and the relationship between items are represented as edges),
node2vec works as follows:

1. Generate item sequences using (biased) random walk.
2. Create positive and negative training examples from these sequences.
3. Train a [word2vec](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec) model
(skip-gram) to learn embeddings for the items.

In this example, we demonstrate the node2vec technique on the
[small version of the Movielens dataset](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest-small-README.html)
to learn movie embeddings. Such a dataset can be represented as a graph by treating
the movies as nodes, and creating edges between movies that have similar ratings
by the users. The learnt movie embeddings can be used for tasks such as movie recommendation,
or movie genres prediction.

This example requires `networkx` package, which can be installed using the following command:

```shell
pip install networkx
```

## Download the MovieLens dataset and prepare the data

The small version of the MovieLens dataset includes around 100k ratings
from 610 users on 9,742 movies.

three data files: `users.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `ratings.csv`. In this example,
we will only need the `movies.dat`, and `ratings.dat` data files.

"""
## Construct the Movies graph

We create an edge between two movie nodes in the graph if both movies are rated
by the same user >= `min_rating`. The weight of the edge will be based on the
[pointwise mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information)
between the two movies, which is computed as: `log(xy) - log(x) - log(y) + log(D)`, where:

* `xy` is how many users rated both movie `x` and movie `y` with >= `min_rating`.
* `x` is how many users rated movie `x` >= `min_rating`.
* `y` is how many users rated movie `y` >= `min_rating`.
* `D` total number of movie ratings >= `min_rating`.

## Implement the biased random walk

A random walk starts from a given node, and randomly picks a neighbour node to move to.
If the edges are weighted, the neighbour is selected *probabilistically* with
respect to weights of the edges between the current node and its neighbours.
This procedure is repeated for `num_steps` to generate a sequence of *related* nodes.

The [*biased* random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biased_random_walk_on_a_graph) balances between **breadth-first sampling**
(where only local neighbours are visited) and **depth-first sampling**
(where  distant neighbours are visited) by introducing the following two parameters:

1. **Return parameter** (`p`): Controls the likelihood of immediately revisiting
a node in the walk. Setting it to a high value encourages moderate exploration,
while setting it to a low value would keep the walk local.
2. **In-out parameter** (`q`): Allows the search to differentiate
between *inward* and *outward* nodes. Setting it to a high value biases the
random walk towards local nodes, while setting it to a low value biases the walk
to visit nodes which are further away.
