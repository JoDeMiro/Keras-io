    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge distillation ([Hinton et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531)) is a technique\n",
    "that enables us to compress larger models into smaller ones. This allows us to reap the\n",
    "benefits of high performing larger models, while reducing storage and memory costs and\n",
    "achieving higher inference speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller models -> smaller memory footprint\n",
    "* Reduced complexity -> fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Knowledge distillation: A good teacher is patient and consistent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05237),\n",
    "Beyer et al. investigate various existing setups for performing knowledge distillation\n",
    "and show that all of them lead to sub-optimal performance. Due to this,\n",
    "practitioners often settle for other alternatives (quantization, pruning, weight\n",
    "clustering, etc.) when developing production systems that are resource-constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyer et al. investigate how we can improve the student models that come out\n",
    "of the knowledge distillation process and always match the performance of\n",
    "their teacher models. In this example, we will study the recipes introduced by them, using\n",
    "the [Flowers102 dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). As a\n",
    "reference, with these recipes, the authors were able to produce a ResNet50 model that\n",
    "achieves 82.8% accuracy on the ImageNet-1k dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you need a refresher on knowledge distillation and want to study how it is\n",
    "implemented in Keras, you can refer to\n",
    "[this example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/knowledge_distillation/).\n",
    "You can also follow\n",
    "[this example](https://keras.io/examples/vision/consistency_training/)\n",
    "that shows an extension of knowledge distillation applied to consistency training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow this example, you will need TensorFlow 2.5 or higher as well as TensorFlow Addons,\n",
