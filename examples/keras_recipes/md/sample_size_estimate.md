## Introduction

In many real-world scenarios, the amount image data available to train a deep learning model is
limited. This is especially true in the medical imaging domain, where dataset creation is
costly. One of the first questions that usually comes up when approaching a new problem is:
**"how many images will we need to train a good enough machine learning model?"**

In most cases, a small set of samples is available, and we can use it to model the relationship
between training data size and model performance. Such a model can be used to estimate the optimal
number of images needed to arrive at a sample size that would achieve the required model performance.

A systematic review of
[Sample-Size Determination Methodologies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335779941_Sample-Size_Determination_Methodologies_for_Machine_Learning_in_Medical_Imaging_Research_A_Systematic_Review)
by Balki et al. provides examples of several sample-size determination methods. In this
example, a balanced subsampling scheme is used to determine the optimal sample size for
our model. This is done by selecting a random subsample consisting of Y number of images
and training the model using the subsample. The model is then evaluated on an independent
test set. This process is repeated N times for each subsample with replacement to allow
for the construction of a mean and confidence interval for the observed performance.

## Setup


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Define seed and fixed variables
seed = 42
tf.random.set_seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)
AUTO = tf.data.AUTOTUNE
```

## Load TensorFlow dataset and convert to NumPy arrays

We'll be using the [TF Flowers dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers).


```python
# Specify dataset parameters
dataset_name = "tf_flowers"
batch_size = 64
image_size = (224, 224)

# Load data from tfds and split 10% off for a test set
(train_data, test_data), ds_info = tfds.load(
    dataset_name,
    split=["train[:90%]", "train[90%:]"],
    shuffle_files=True,
    as_supervised=True,
    with_info=True,
)

# Extract number of classes and list of class names
num_classes = ds_info.features["label"].num_classes
class_names = ds_info.features["label"].names

print(f"Number of classes: {num_classes}")
print(f"Class names: {class_names}")

# Convert datasets to NumPy arrays
def dataset_to_array(dataset, image_size, num_classes):
    images, labels = [], []
    for img, lab in dataset.as_numpy_iterator():
        images.append(tf.image.resize(img, image_size).numpy())
        labels.append(tf.one_hot(lab, num_classes))
    return np.array(images), np.array(labels)


img_train, label_train = dataset_to_array(train_data, image_size, num_classes)
img_test, label_test = dataset_to_array(test_data, image_size, num_classes)

num_train_samples = len(img_train)
print(f"Number of training samples: {num_train_samples}")
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
Number of classes: 5
Class names: ['dandelion', 'daisy', 'tulips', 'sunflowers', 'roses']
Number of training samples: 3303

```
</div>
## Plot a few examples from the test set


```python
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))
for n in range(30):
    ax = plt.subplot(5, 6, n + 1)
    plt.imshow(img_test[n].astype("uint8"))
    plt.title(np.array(class_names)[label_test[n] == True][0])
    plt.axis("off")
```

## Augmentation

Define image augmentation using keras preprocessing layers and apply them to the training set.


```python
# Define image augmentation model
image_augmentation = keras.Sequential(
    [
        layers.RandomFlip(mode="horizontal"),
        layers.RandomRotation(factor=0.1),
        layers.RandomZoom(height_factor=(-0.1, -0)),
        layers.RandomContrast(factor=0.1),
    ],
)

# Apply the augmentations to the training images and plot a few examples
img_train = image_augmentation(img_train).numpy()

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))
for n in range(30):
    ax = plt.subplot(5, 6, n + 1)
    plt.imshow(img_train[n].astype("uint8"))
    plt.title(np.array(class_names)[label_train[n] == True][0])
    plt.axis("off")
```

## Define model building & training functions

We create a few convenience functions to build a transfer-learning model, compile and
train it and unfreeze layers for fine-tuning.


```python

def build_model(num_classes, img_size=image_size[0], top_dropout=0.3):
    """Creates a classifier based on pre-trained MobileNetV2.

    Arguments:
        num_classes: Int, number of classese to use in the softmax layer.

    """

    # Create input and pre-processing layers for MobileNetV2
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=(img_size, img_size, 3))
    x = layers.Rescaling(scale=1.0 / 127.5, offset=-1)(inputs)
    model = keras.applications.MobileNetV2(
        include_top=False, weights="imagenet", input_tensor=x
    )

    # Freeze the pretrained weights
    model.trainable = False

    # Rebuild top
    x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(name="avg_pool")(model.output)
    x = layers.Dropout(top_dropout)(x)
    outputs = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax")(x)

    """Compiles and trains the model.

    stopper = keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(
        monitor="val_auc",

        min_delta=0,
        patience=patience,
        verbose=1,
        restore_best_weights=True,
    )

    model.compile(loss="categorical_crossentropy", optimizer=optimizer, metrics=metrics)

    history = model.fit(
        x=training_data,

def unfreeze(model, block_name, verbose=0):
    """Unfreezes Keras model layers.

    # Unfreeze from block_name onwards
    set_trainable = False

    for layer in model.layers:
        if block_name in layer.name:
            set_trainable = True
        if set_trainable and not isinstance(layer, layers.BatchNormalization):
            layer.trainable = True
            if verbose == 1:
                print(layer.name, "trainable")

    print("Trainable weights:", len(model.trainable_weights))
    print("Non-trainable weights:", len(model.non_trainable_weights))
    return model

```

## Define iterative training function

To train a model over several subsample sets we need to create an iterative training function.


```python

def train_model(training_data, training_labels):
    """Trains the model as follows:

    - Trains only the top layers for 10 epochs.
    - Unfreezes deeper layers.
    - Train for 20 more epochs.

        training_labels: NumPy Array, trainig labels.

    Returns:
        Model accuracy.
    """

    model = build_model(num_classes)

    # Compile and train top layers
    history = compile_and_train(
        model,
        training_data,
        training_labels,
        metrics=[keras.metrics.AUC(name="auc"), "acc"],
        optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(),
        patience=3,
        epochs=10,
    )

    # Unfreeze model from block 10 onwards
    model = unfreeze(model, "block_10")

    # Compile and train for 20 epochs with a lower learning rate
    fine_tune_epochs = 20
    total_epochs = history.epoch[-1] + fine_tune_epochs

    history_fine = compile_and_train(
        model,
        training_data,
        training_labels,
        metrics=[keras.metrics.AUC(name="auc"), "acc"],
        optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4),
        patience=5,
        epochs=total_epochs,
    )

    # Calculate model accuracy on the test set
    _, _, acc = model.evaluate(img_test, label_test)
    return np.round(acc, 4)

```

## Train models iteratively

Now that we have model building functions and supporting iterative functions we can train
the model over several subsample splits.

- We select the subsample splits as 5%, 10%, 25% and 50% of the downloaded dataset. We
pretend that only 50% of the actual data is available at present.
- We train the model 5 times from scratch at each split and record the accuracy values.

Note that this trains 20 models and will take some time. Make sure you have a GPU runtime
active.

To keep this example lightweight, sample data from a previous training run is provided.


```python

def train_iteratively(sample_splits=[0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5], iter_per_split=5):
    """Trains a model iteratively over several sample splits.

    Arguments:
        sample_splits: List/NumPy array, contains fractions of the trainins set
                        to train over.
        iter_per_split: Int, number of times to train a model per sample split.

    Returns:
        Training accuracy for all splits and iterations and the number of samples
        used for training at each split.
    """
    # Train all the sample models and calculate accuracy
    train_acc = []
    sample_sizes = []

    for fraction in sample_splits:
        print(f"Fraction split: {fraction}")
        # Repeat training 3 times for each sample size
        sample_accuracy = []
        num_samples = int(num_train_samples * fraction)
        for i in range(iter_per_split):
            print(f"Run {i+1} out of {iter_per_split}:")
            # Create fractional subsets
            rand_idx = np.random.randint(num_train_samples, size=num_samples)
            train_img_subset = img_train[rand_idx, :]
            train_label_subset = label_train[rand_idx, :]
            # Train model and calculate accuracy
            accuracy = train_model(train_img_subset, train_label_subset)
            print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
            sample_accuracy.append(accuracy)
        train_acc.append(sample_accuracy)
        sample_sizes.append(num_samples)
    return train_acc, sample_sizes


# Running the above function produces the following outputs
train_acc = [
    [0.8202, 0.7466, 0.8011, 0.8447, 0.8229],

sample_sizes = [165, 330, 825, 1651]
```

## Learning curve

We now plot the learning curve by fitting an exponential curve through the mean accuracy
points. We use TF to fit an exponential function through the data.

We then extrapolate the learning curve to the predict the accuracy of a model trained on
the whole training set.


```python

                    each split.

        # Get gradients and compute adjusted weights
        gradients = tape.gradient(cost_function, [a, b])

From the extrapolated curve we can see that 3303 images will yield an estimated
accuracy of about 95%.

Now, let's use all the data (3303 images) and train the model to see if our prediction
was accurate!


```python
# Now train the model with full dataset to get the actual accuracy
accuracy = train_model(img_train, label_train)
print(f"A model accuracy of {accuracy} is reached on {num_train_samples} images!")

## Conclusion

We see that a model accuracy of about 94-96%* is reached using 3303 images. This is quite
close to our estimate!

Even though we used only 50% of the dataset (1651 images) we were able to model the training
behaviour of our model and predict the model accuracy for a given amount of images. This same
methodology can be used to predict the amount of images needed to reach a desired accuracy.
This is very useful when a smaller set of data is available, and it has been shown that
convergence on a deep learning model is possible, but more images are needed. The image count
prediction can be used to plan and budget for further image collection initiatives.
